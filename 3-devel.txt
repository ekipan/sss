\ experiment with a game in progress!
\ type "bg" to draw the canvas, then:
\ move, rotate, repaint:
2 1 go . dd
\ out of bounds:
8 0 go . dd
\ put a white block:
1 #88 well + c! dd
\ savestate, resume:
ss ( r )
\ retry:
ll ( r )
\ edit, recompile:
( v sss.fs )
redo ( r )
\ try things! del key breaks canvas.
\ "bg" redraws tho you lose the log.
